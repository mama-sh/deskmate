 *
 * Plain `vercel deploy` / `eve deploy` build a function that drops eve's internal
 * `#…` files (see `patchVercelEveTrace`) and 500s on every route. Building locally
 * and patching the output before a `--prebuilt` upload sidesteps that. Passthrough
 * args (e.g. `--yes`, `--token`, `--scope`) go to `vercel pull`, `vercel build`, AND
 * `vercel deploy` — each step needs the same auth/scope in CI. Note `vercel pull`
 * accepts a narrower flag set than build/deploy, so a deploy-only flag like
 * `--target` is rejected there first (harmless here — the recipe is `--prod`-pinned).
 *
 * Requires the Vercel CLI installed and authenticated (`vercel login`).
